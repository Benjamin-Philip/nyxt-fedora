* About

This repository contains the RPM specs for [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer][Nyxt]], an extensible browser with
support for Emacs, Vim and CUA bindings. Currently it builds on Copr, but it may
be added to Fedora's official rpm repository.

* Install

To use this spec, and thus install Nyxt, you must first enable the copr:

#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf copr enable bphilip/nyxt
#+end_src

and then install the copr:

#+begin_src bash
sudo dnf install nyxt
#+end_src
